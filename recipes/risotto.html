    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This delicious Instant Pot risotto with tender mushrooms and Parmesan cheese is so simple and fuss-free to make. It tastes like a fancy dish ordered at an Italian restaurant! You'll probably start making risotto in your pressure cooker far more often after you try this recipe.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>3 cups diced mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 sprig rosemary</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups Arborio rice</li>
        <li>¾ cup white wine</li>
        <li>1 quart chicken or vegetable stock</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) and select Sauté function. Add butter and olive oil; stir until butter melts, about 2 minutes. Add mushrooms; cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in onion; cook for 2 minutes. Add rosemary sprig; cook for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Stir rice into the pot until each grain is coated with butter and olive oil mixture, about 2 minutes. Pour in wine; simmer for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in stock, stirring to scrape the sides of the pot. Simmer for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Close and lock the lid. Turn the venting knob to sealing. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 6 minutes. It will take time for pressure to build.</li>
        <li>Tap venting knob a few times with a wooden spoon or spatula. Stand back; turn knob to point at vent. Remove lid when pressure is released, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir risotto until creamy, about 1 minute. Discard rosemary sprig. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in Parmesan cheese until melted and combined.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
